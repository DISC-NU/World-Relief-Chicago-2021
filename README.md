# DISC: WRC Match

## Description
[WRC Match](https://disc-wrcmatch.web.app/) is a web application created by student developers at Northwestern's [Develop + Innovate for Social Change (DISC) club](https://www.discnu.com/) during the winter & spring 2021 academic quarters for [World Relief Chicagoland (WRC)](https://chicagoland.worldrelief.org/), an organzation that (in their own words) aims to provide "sustainable solutions to the world’s greatest problems – disasters, extreme poverty, violence, oppression, and mass displacement." The application allows members of the organization to upload a CSV file consisting of a list of jobs & then easily filter those jobs by parameters such as English level, time shifts, distance/location, among other categories. The hope is that in doing so, WRC members can more easily find suitable jobs for refugees & other clients they are working with.
